I am a manager/prorieter of a local coffee shop. I started Data Analytics bootcamp to learn skills 
to help my business and expand my knowledge. I hope to find work as full time data analyst.

In my spare time I enjoy running, hiking and spending time with my dogs. I am looking forward to 
achieving my lifelong dream of running the Boston Marathon in 2019. I also enjoy brewing my own beer,
and cooking.
